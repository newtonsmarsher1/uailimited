# Multi-Device Login System Integration Guide

## üöÄ System Overview

The multi-device login system allows users to login from up to **3 devices simultaneously** with secure device tracking and management capabilities.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### Database Changes:
- ‚úÖ **`user_devices` table** - Tracks all user devices
- ‚úÖ **`max_devices` column** - Sets device limit per user (default: 3)
- ‚úÖ **`device_count` column** - Tracks active device count
- ‚úÖ **Indexes** - Optimized for fast queries

### Backend Components:
- ‚úÖ **Multi-device authentication middleware** - `backend/middleware/multi-device-auth.js`
- ‚úÖ **Device management API** - `backend/routes/device-management.js`
- ‚úÖ **Device fingerprinting** - Secure device identification
- ‚úÖ **Automatic cleanup** - Removes old devices when limit reached

### Frontend Components:
- ‚úÖ **Device manager** - `frontend/js/device-manager.js`
- ‚úÖ **Device management UI** - `frontend/device-management.html`
- ‚úÖ **Device tracking** - Automatic device detection

## üîß Integration Steps

### Step 1: Update Your Main App

Replace your current authentication middleware:

```javascript
// OLD: const { auth } = require('../middleware/auth.js');
// NEW: 
const { multiDeviceAuth } = require('../middleware/multi-device-auth.js');

// Use multiDeviceAuth instead of auth in your routes
router.get('/protected-route', multiDeviceAuth, (req, res) => {
  // req.user now includes device information
  console.log('User:', req.user.id);
  console.log('Device:', req.user.deviceId);
});
```

### Step 2: Update Login Endpoint

Replace your current login with the multi-device version:

```javascript
// Use the new device management routes
app.use('/api/auth', require('./routes/device-management.js'));
```

### Step 3: Add Device Management to Frontend

Add device management to your main app:

```html
<!-- Add to your main HTML file -->
<script src="js/device-manager.js"></script>

<!-- Add device management link to your menu -->
<a href="device-management.html">Manage Devices</a>
```

### Step 4: Update Task Routes

Update your task routes to use multi-device auth:

```javascript
// In backend/routes/tasks.js
const { multiDeviceAuth } = require('../middleware/multi-device-auth.js');

// Replace auth with multiDeviceAuth
router.get('/', multiDeviceAuth, async (req, res) => {
  // Your existing task logic
});
```

## üì± API Endpoints

### Authentication:
- **POST** `/api/auth/login` - Login with multi-device support
- **POST** `/api/auth/logout` - Logout from current device
- **POST** `/api/auth/logout-all` - Logout from all devices

### Device Management:
- **GET** `/api/devices` - Get user's active devices
- **DELETE** `/api/devices/:id` - Remove specific device
- **PUT** `/api/devices/:id` - Update device name
- **GET** `/api/devices/info` - Get device management info

## üéØ Features

### For Users:
- ‚úÖ **Login from 3 devices** simultaneously
- ‚úÖ **View all active devices** with details
- ‚úÖ **Remove specific devices** remotely
- ‚úÖ **Rename devices** for easy identification
- ‚úÖ **Logout from all devices** at once
- ‚úÖ **Device activity tracking**

### For Security:
- ‚úÖ **Device fingerprinting** - Unique device identification
- ‚úÖ **Token per device** - Each device has its own token
- ‚úÖ **Automatic cleanup** - Old devices removed when limit reached
- ‚úÖ **Activity tracking** - Monitor device usage
- ‚úÖ **Secure logout** - Invalidate tokens properly

## üîç How It Works

### 1. Device Registration:
When a user logs in:
1. System generates device fingerprint from browser headers
2. Checks if device already exists for user
3. If new device and limit reached, removes oldest device
4. Creates new device record with unique token
5. Updates user's device count

### 2. Authentication:
On each request:
1. Verifies JWT token
2. Checks device fingerprint matches
3. Validates device is active
4. Updates last activity timestamp
5. Allows access if all checks pass

### 3. Device Management:
Users can:
- View all their active devices
- See device details (OS, browser, last activity)
- Remove specific devices
- Rename devices for identification
- Logout from all devices

## üß™ Testing

### Test Multi-Device Login:
1. Login from desktop browser
2. Login from mobile browser
3. Login from tablet
4. Check device management page
5. Try to login from 4th device (should remove oldest)

### Test Device Management:
1. Access device management page
2. Rename a device
3. Remove a device
4. Logout from all devices
5. Verify all devices are logged out

## üìä Database Schema

### user_devices Table:
```sql
- id (INT) - Primary key
- user_id (INT) - Foreign key to users
- device_fingerprint (VARCHAR) - Unique device identifier
- device_name (VARCHAR) - User-friendly device name
- device_info (JSON) - Device details (OS, browser, etc.)
- login_token (VARCHAR) - JWT token for this device
- is_active (BOOLEAN) - Whether device is active
- last_activity (TIMESTAMP) - Last activity time
- created_at (TIMESTAMP) - Device registration time
```

### users Table Updates:
```sql
- max_devices (INT) - Maximum devices allowed (default: 3)
- device_count (INT) - Current active device count
```

## üö® Important Notes

### Security Considerations:
- Device fingerprints are generated from browser headers
- Each device has its own JWT token
- Tokens are invalidated when device is removed
- Activity is tracked for security monitoring

### Performance:
- Database indexes optimize device queries
- Device cleanup happens automatically
- Minimal overhead on authentication

### User Experience:
- Seamless login experience
- Clear device management interface
- Automatic device limit enforcement
- Easy device identification and management

## üîÑ Migration from Single Device

If you're migrating from single-device login:

1. **Backup your current auth system**
2. **Apply the multi-device system**
3. **Update your routes to use multiDeviceAuth**
4. **Test thoroughly**
5. **Deploy gradually**

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

You'll know the system is working when:
- Users can login from multiple devices
- Device management page shows all devices
- Old devices are automatically removed when limit reached
- Device activity is tracked properly
- Logout works from all devices

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Device not recognized**: Check device fingerprint generation
- **Token errors**: Verify JWT secret is consistent
- **Database errors**: Check table structure and indexes
- **Frontend issues**: Verify device manager script is loaded

### Debug Mode:
Enable debug logging in the middleware to see device fingerprint generation and validation.
