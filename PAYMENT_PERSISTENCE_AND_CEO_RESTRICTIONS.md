# UAI Agency - Payment Persistence and CEO Restrictions

## ðŸŽ¯ Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Under Review Persistence

**Problem Solved:** The Payment Under Review page was refreshing when users navigated to other pages, losing the payment status.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Global Payment Monitoring System**: Created `js/payment-monitor.js` that runs across all pages
- **Persistent Status Tracking**: Payment status is monitored globally using localStorage and periodic API calls
- **Cross-Page Notifications**: Users receive notifications when payment status changes, regardless of which page they're on
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Payment data is automatically cleared when payment is approved/rejected

**How it Works:**
1. When a user submits a recharge request, the payment data is stored in localStorage
2. The global monitoring system starts tracking the payment status every 30 seconds
3. If the user navigates to other pages, the monitoring continues in the background
4. When payment status changes (approved/rejected), a notification appears and localStorage is cleared
5. The monitoring stops automatically when payment is no longer pending

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/js/payment-monitor.js` (new)
- `frontend/recharge-method1.html` (updated)
- `frontend/home.html` (added script)
- `frontend/recharge-method2.html` (added script)
- `frontend/recharge-method3.html` (added script)
- `frontend/recharge-method4.html` (added script)

### 2. CEO Restrictions for Financial Managers

**Problem Solved:** Non-CEO users could potentially add or delete financial managers.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Frontend Restrictions**: Financial details page only shows management interface to CEOs
- **Backend Security**: All financial manager endpoints require CEO role verification
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Clear error messages when non-CEO users try to access restricted features
- **Pending Payment Protection**: Financial managers with pending payments cannot be deleted

**Security Features:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for all financial manager operations
- Server-side validation of CEO role before any financial manager operations
- Protection against deletion of financial managers with pending payments
- Comprehensive logging of all CEO actions

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/admin-portal/public/financial-details.html` (already had restrictions)
- `frontend/admin-portal/server.js` (enhanced security)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Global Payment Monitor Functions

```javascript
// Start global payment monitoring
startGlobalPaymentMonitoring(transactionNumber, paymentData)

// Stop global payment monitoring
stopGlobalPaymentMonitoring()

// Register callback for payment status changes
onPaymentStatusChange(callback)

// Show global payment notification
showGlobalPaymentNotification(status, reason)
```

### CEO Restriction Checks

```javascript
// Frontend check
if (!userRole || userRole !== 'CEO') {
  // Show access denied message
}

// Backend check
if (adminRows.length === 0 || adminRows[0].role !== 'CEO') {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Only CEO can perform this action' });
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Run the test script to verify both features:

```bash
cd backend
node test-payment-persistence.js
```

This will test:
- Payment creation and status checking
- Global payment monitoring
- CEO restrictions
- Cross-page persistence

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Submit a recharge request as normal
2. Navigate to any page - the payment status will continue to be monitored
3. You'll receive a notification when the payment is approved/rejected
4. The monitoring automatically stops when payment is processed

### For CEOs:
1. Access the Financial Details page in the admin portal
2. Add, edit, or delete financial managers as needed
3. System will prevent deletion of managers with pending payments

### For Non-CEO Admins:
1. Access to Financial Details page will be restricted
2. Clear error messages will explain the restriction
3. All financial manager operations will be blocked

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- All CEO actions are logged for audit purposes
- Financial managers with pending payments are protected from deletion
- Role verification happens on both frontend and backend
- Payment monitoring uses secure API calls with authentication tokens
- localStorage data is automatically cleaned up when payments are processed

## ðŸš€ Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users don't lose payment status when navigating
2. **Enhanced Security**: Only CEOs can manage financial managers
3. **Data Integrity**: Pending payments are protected from accidental deletion
4. **Real-time Updates**: Users get immediate notifications of payment status changes
5. **Cross-platform**: Works on all pages and devices
