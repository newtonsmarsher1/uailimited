# IPv6 Setup for UAI Agency Domain

## 🔍 Current Status
Your network currently doesn't have IPv6 connectivity configured. Here are your options:

## 🚀 Option 1: Enable IPv6 on Your Network

### Step 1: Check Router IPv6 Support
1. Access your router admin panel: http://192.168.100.1
2. Look for "IPv6" settings or "Dual Stack" configuration
3. Enable IPv6 if available

### Step 2: Windows IPv6 Configuration
```powershell
# Check IPv6 status
netsh interface ipv6 show interfaces

# Enable IPv6 if disabled
netsh interface ipv6 set global randomizeidentifiers=disabled
netsh interface ipv6 set privacy state=disabled
```

### Step 3: Get IPv6 Address
Once enabled, you can get your IPv6 address:
```powershell
# Get public IPv6 address
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://api64.ipify.org' -UseBasicParsing).Content
```

## 🌐 Option 2: Use IPv6 Tunneling Services

### Hurricane Electric (Free IPv6 Tunnel)
1. Go to https://tunnelbroker.net
2. Create free account
3. Create new tunnel
4. Configure your router with tunnel settings

### Benefits of IPv6:
- ✅ **Better connectivity** (bypasses some restrictions)
- ✅ **No NAT issues** (direct addressing)
- ✅ **Future-proof** (modern internet standard)
- ✅ **Better for tunneling services**

## 🎯 Option 3: Alternative Solutions (Recommended for Now)

Since IPv6 setup might take time, here are immediate alternatives:

### A. Use Cloudflare Tunnel (No IPv6 needed)
```bash
# This bypasses port forwarding entirely
cloudflared tunnel create uaigency
cloudflared tunnel route dns uaigency uaigency.your-domain.com
```

### B. Use ngrok with Custom Domain
```bash
# If you have ngrok pro, you can use custom domains
ngrok http 3000 --domain=uaigency.ngrok.io
```

### C. Use Current Working Tunnels
Your current working tunnels:
- **Serveo**: `https://e21c81d1b65ac05b4fefd4d052170c85.serveo.net`
- **Localtunnel**: `https://young-peas-refuse.loca.lt`

## 🔧 Quick IPv6 Test
To test if IPv6 is working:
```powershell
# Test IPv6 connectivity
ping -6 ipv6.google.com
```

## 📋 Recommended Action Plan

1. **Immediate**: Use your working Serveo tunnel
2. **Short-term**: Set up DuckDNS with IPv4 (current setup)
3. **Long-term**: Enable IPv6 for better connectivity

## 🎯 Current Best Solution
Use your working Serveo tunnel: `https://e21c81d1b65ac05b4fefd4d052170c85.serveo.net`

This provides:
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ No restrictions
- ✅ Worldwide access
- ✅ No IPv6 dependency
